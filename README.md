# Zomato-data-analysis
This project explores a dataset of Zomato restaurants, analyzing various factors such as ratings, cost, and customer engagement (votes). Using Python data science libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis provides insights into:

Rating Trends: Understanding the distribution of restaurant ratings and factors influencing them, such as online order availability and table booking options.
Cost Analysis: Examining the relationship between the cost for two people and ratings/votes, and how pricing affects customer engagement.
Impact of Online Orders & Table Bookings: Assessing how offering online orders and table bookings can affect restaurant ratings.
Category-wise Performance: Grouping restaurants by listing type (Buffet, Cafe, Dining, etc.) and analyzing average ratings, costs, and votes.
Correlation Analysis: Investigating the relationships between key numerical features like votes, cost, and ratings.

Key Features:
  Data Cleaning: Handling and transforming rating data for numerical analysis.
  Visualizations: Detailed histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps for comprehensive data understanding.
  Business Insights: Key takeaways for improving restaurant performance based on data trends.

Technologies:
  Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
  Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and visualization
